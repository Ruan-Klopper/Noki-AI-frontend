# Noki-AI-frontend

## PLEASE INCLUDE USABILITY TESTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Remove endpoints that are not being used on the frontend, in the backend

## Plase also do a presentation

# problems

## Issues I had, time out with canvas link data, time out wasnt set, so i setted one

# features

## Decided to store user data in index db since its a better approach than cache storage and local storage, better for your crud functionality, and makes your website quite fast

### User testing results

- features to implement etc
- issues to fix in the newer version

### planning and inspiration for this project:

Inspiration:

- I personally struggled with time managament, hence I came up with this idea
- I took inspiration from how Canvas and trello works with managing your schedule and see how i can make a better app / version of those

Future implementations:

- Sync with blackboard
- Much more friendlier User Interface
- Team collaborations on todos and projects etc

# For the presentation:

- Explain uses and impletation in all projects frontend - backedn Ai service

Seporate this ReadME in two parts
First part: Explain NOKI AI, since the frontend repo is the "main repo"

- Noki AI logo
- Mockup images
- Navigation to other respositories
  -- Noki-AI-Frontend (This respository)
  -- Noki-AI-Backend
  -- Noki-AI-AIServer

Demo video -> Link to demo video

- How the 3 repositories link with each another
  -- Will be an image placeholder for the diagram
  -- Frontend -> Backend -> AI Server

Seccond part, the actual frontend respository
-- Frontend
---- Services
---- use cases
---- services setups & config file & barear token with JWt how user ID is managed, efficient use of that
